## Get Stock Firmware

Now that the driver is installed and Visual Studio Code runs with the Platformio plugin let's try if we can compile and install the stock firmware.
Get the stock firmware repository either with git:

```
git clone  https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp32-icon64-a2dp
```
or by downloading and extracting the zip file.
