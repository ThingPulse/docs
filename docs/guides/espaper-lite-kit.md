The ThingPulse ESPaper Lite Kit is the more bare-bone version of its bigger sister the ESPaper Plus Kit. As it is 
intended for more tech-savvy customers who are not IoT novices there is no specific guide for the Lite Kit. Instead 
customers should read the [Plus Kit guide](espaper-plus-kit.md) and skip the chapters they are already familiar with.
