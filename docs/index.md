# ThingPulse Documentation

This is the home of the documentation of all [ThingPulse products](https://thingpulse.com/shop/). This is 
deliberately maintained in the open [on GitHub](https://github.com/thingpulse/docs/) so that it's easy for you to 
report, and potentially fix, the unavoidable typo.

The content is split into two main sections:

- **Guides**: a single self-contained guide for every product
- **How-tos**: instructions for a single topic that is not tied to a specific product, they are included in the guides 
where applicable
