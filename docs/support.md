# Support

For its customers ThingPulse maintains a support forum at https://support.thingpulse.com. If you are stuck with any 
of the guides or the how-tos you are welcome to ask for help there. While ThingPulse monitors activity in the forum 
the community is encouraged to engage as well.

It is quite likely that your question has been asked before by other customers. A quick search will unearth it.
