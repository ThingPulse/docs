As your device will be displaying data from [Weather Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground_(weather_service) ) 
you need an "API key" from them. It uniquely ties requests from your device(s) to your account and ensures that the 
number of requests remains withing your allotted quota.

- Go to [https://docs.thingpulse.com/go/create-wunderground-key](/go/create-wunderground-key)
- Select the "Stratus Plan".
- Take note of the "Developer" rate limits and hit the "Purchase Key" (even if you do not actually purchase) button.

- Fill in required information about how you intend to use the API key

Once the API key is created you can come back to this page any time to regenerate or edit it.
