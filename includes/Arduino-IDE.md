The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the tool you will use to program the ESP8266. IDEs are more 
than just editors; they help you with various tasks during the development process.

To install the Arduino IDE go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software and download the latest version for your 
operating system:

- For macOS you can download a ZIP file which you then have to extract.Take the extracted application “Arduino” and 
move it to your 'Applications' folder.
- For Windows you have the option between an executable installer and a ZIP file.The ZIP file might be the better 
option if you do not have administrator permissions on your system. The installer on the other hand can put the 
libraries in the proper places.

Now you have a bare Arduino IDE which brings everything needed to write programs for the standard Arduino ATmega chips.
But we want to write and compile code for the ESP8266.
